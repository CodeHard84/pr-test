// Sure would be nice if someone would add a way to 'alert' 
// a user with an alert and display their name.

console.log('Hello World!');

// Prompt the user for their name
var userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");

// Display an alert with the user's name
alert("Hello, " + userName + "!");
